HTML Guidelines
When working with HTML, it's essential to follow established guidelines to ensure clean, maintainable, and accessible

HTML5 Page Skeleton
To create the skeleton of an HTML5 page, use the following basic structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>

Semantic HTML Tags
Utilize semantic HTML tags to give meaning to the content and structure of your web page. Examples include <header>, <main>, <footer>, <article>, <nav>, <section>, and <aside>.

Use Cases: div vs span
Use <div> for block-level containers and <span> for inline containers. <div> is suitable for grouping larger sections, while <span> is handy for styling smaller portions of text.

Semantic Values
<header>: Represents a group of introductory or navigational aids.
<main>: Contains the central content of the document.
<footer>: Represents the footer of a section or a page.
<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently.
<nav>: Represents a navigation menu.
<section>: Represents a generic section of a document.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it.
Headings Hierarchy
Use headings (<h1>, <h2>, ..., <h6>) to structure content hierarchically. Following the correct hierarchical order is important for accessibility and SEO.

Lists in HTML
Create lists using <ul> (unordered list) or <ol> (ordered list) for semantic markup. Use <li> (list item) for individual items in the list.

Differences Between Media Types
Understand the differences between media types, such as SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), PNG (Portable Network Graphics), and JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), to choose the appropriate format based on your use case.

Table Structure
Use the <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> elements to structure data in a table.

Video Integration
Integrate a video into a webpage using the <video> element. Include the source file and provide fallback content for compatibility.

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Audio File Integration
Integrate an audio file into a webpage using the <audio> element. Include the source file and provide fallback content for compatibility.

<audio controls>
    <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
    Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>


Embedding External Content
Embed external content, such as iframes for maps, videos, or other resources, using the <iframe> element.

<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Correct HTML Page Structure
Ensure a correct HTML page structure by following the guidelines mentioned above. Keep your code organized, use semantic tags appropriately, and structure content logically for better accessibility and maintainability.
